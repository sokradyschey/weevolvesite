We seek to move the tech industry forward, in continued evolution, leaving toxic culture behind and pursuing equity, inclusivity, accessibility and belonging for all. We also create space for shared interests (like plants, cooking, digital design, Gritty) with a strict code of conduct self-enforced by all.
