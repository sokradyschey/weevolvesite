# We Evolve Website

This website is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) with the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating engine.

It is designed to keep content as separate as possible from layout so that anyone can update the website's content without needing to fiddle with any html or css.

All content is written in markdown (.md) and fed into Nunjucks template files found in the `_includes` folder (see [Repo structure](#repo-structure)).


## How to install for development

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies
3. `npm start` builds the site in the `_site` directory and launches the development server at `localhost:8080`
